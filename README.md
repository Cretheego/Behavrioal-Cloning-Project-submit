**Behavrioal Cloning Project ** 

## Introduction
__Files in project__

In this project I maintain following  files:

model.py  containing  all of the CNN model functionality
model_func.py containing   many functions utilized in the model.py.
drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
writeup_report.md summarizing the results

I used the data generated by simulator to train my model by keyboard.
